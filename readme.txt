Description:
________________


Tourista is a web app that uses your phone’s GPS to pinpoint your location, shares information about different spots around you, using a pop-up imagery. Rather than spend a large sum of money for guided tours, Tourista gives you the ability to take a tour at your own pace for free!.


Product Specification:
________________
The application uses JavaScript, Google Maps API, Google Street API and Wikipedia API to develop the web app.  Vanilla Javascript and hosted on Bitballoon.
We used Google Maps API to fetch local destination and get a panoramic view, Vanilla JS to detect user location and orientation, Wikipedia API to fetch data about locations.
